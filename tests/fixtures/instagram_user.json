This weekend, the goal is to celebrate home in all its forms \u2014 the people, the places, the things \u2014 and what makes them feel special.\nHere are some tips to get started:\nTake a portrait of your parents, siblings or the loved ones you grew up with. Work to tell their story in a single photograph.\nNotice the little details. Whether it\u2019s your mother\u2019s favorite books lined up on the shelf, the table that you\u2019ve eaten dinner around since you were a child or a tire swing in the front yard, consider the specific elements that make it feel like home.\nGet creative with video to capture the smells, sounds and tastes of your hometown. How can you show what you would otherwise have to be there to experience?\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPhomesweethome hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.\nFeatured photo by @sarahwilkerson",

He\u2019s the founder of Andy\u2019s Man Club (@andysmanclubuk), a UK-based community that offers men a space to talk about the real issues affecting their lives. \u201cIt really upset me that Andrew didn\u2019t speak, and I realized that lots of people are struggling to talk, and no one was offering a safe space. I came up with the idea for a coffee club that came from me and the old man, me dad. We used to meet every Saturday morning. I started thinking: \u2018Why couldn\u2019t we turn this into a Monday evening, where guys can come and talk about real stuff?\u2019 Now, we\u2019ve got 11 clubs all across the country, and we\u2019re hoping to expand now across the world.\nI wish people could understand more of what people are actually going through \u2014 not everything is as it seems. If you walk into a coffee shop and someone behind the counter is a bit snappy with you, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re an ignorant or arrogant person. They might just be dealing with stuff. It\u2019s about not taking anything that you can see on the surface and being a bit more compassionate to others, really. We\u2019re all dealing with stuff constantly.\u201d #hereforyou\nLearn more about how our community is sharing their mental health journeys and supporting one another.

This is the third temporary restaurant that Ren\u00e9 has created in as many years, taking Noma \u2013 his Copenhagen restaurant that's consistently ranked one of the best restaurants in the world since it opened in 2003 \u2013 on the road with its full 145-person team.\nAfter hosting the Noma pop up in Tokyo and Sydney, Ren\u00e9 was drawn to Mexico's culinary heritage. \u201cMexican cuisine is so vast and varied,\u201d says Ren\u00e9. \u201cFood traditions have been preserved and passed on across thousands of years, and with the tremendous biodiversity, it is an incredibly genuine, complex and delicious cuisine.\u201d You won't find Noma's dishes translated with Mexican ingredients, though. No matter where in the world he is, Ren\u00e9's cooking is \u201cless of a style, and more of a way of thinking,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's a consideration of the land, the history, the people and the ingredients themselves.\u201d\nWatch our Instagram Story now to experience Noma in Tulum, compliments of the chef.\nVideo by @reneredzepinoma",
